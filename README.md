# pandora-likes-parser
Script that collects thumbed up songs from an account at pandora.com and saves them to a text file for further use.

# youtube-downloader
This script searches youtube for songs in 'songs.txt' and downloads them as mp3 files. Keep in mind that for more obscure songs
it's possible for the script to download live/alternative versions, or even entirely unrelated audios if there isn't any
version to be found on youtube.
